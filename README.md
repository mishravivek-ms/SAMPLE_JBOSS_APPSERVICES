# Deploying a Jakarta EE Application on Azure using PaaS
This demo shows how you can deploy a Jakarta EE application to Azure using managed JBoss EAP. The following is how you run the demo.

## Setup
* You will need an Azure subscription. If you don't have one, you can get one for free for one year [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free).

## Start Managed PostgreSQL on Azure
We will be using the fully managed PostgreSQL offering in Azure for this demo. If you have not set it up yet, please do so now. 

* Go to the [Azure portal](http://portal.azure.com).
* Select 'Create a resource'. In the search box, enter and select 'Azure Database for PostgreSQL'. Hit create. Select a single server. Hit create again.
* Create a new resource group named jakartaee-cafe-group-`<your suffix>` (the suffix could be your first name such as "reza"). Specify the Server name to be jakartaee-cafe-db-`<your suffix>` (the suffix could be your first name such as "reza"). Specify the login name to be postgres. Specify the password to be Secret123!. Create the resource. It will take a moment for the database to deploy and be ready for use.
* In the portal home, go to 'All resources'. Find and click on jakartaee-cafe-db-`<your suffix>`. Open the connection security panel. Enable access to Azure services, add the current client IP address, disable SSL connection enforcement, and then hit 'Save'.

Once you are done exploring the demo, you should delete the jakartaee-cafe-group-`<your suffix>` resource group. You can do this by going to the portal, going to resource groups, finding and clicking on jakartaee-cafe-group-`<your suffix>` and hitting delete. This is especially important if you are not using a free subscription! If you do keep these resources around (for example to begin your own prototype), you should in the least use your own passwords and make the corresponding changes in the demo code.

## Setup Managed JBoss EAP
* Go to the [Azure portal](http://portal.azure.com).
* Select 'Create a resource'. In the search box, enter and select 'Web App'. Hit create.
* Enter jakartaee-cafe-web-`<your suffix>` (the suffix could be your first name such as "reza") as application name and select jakartaee-cafe-group-`<your suffix>` as the resource group. Choose Java 11 as your runtime stack and JBoss EAP 7 as the Java web server stack. Hit create.
* In the portal home, go to 'All resources'. Find and click on the resource named jakartaee-cafe-web-`<your suffix>` of type App Service. Go to the Deployment Center -> FTPS credentials. Note the application scoped FTP access information on this page. Connect with your favorite FTP client using this access information.
* Go to where this application is on your local machine. Go to the paas directory. Open the [jboss_cli_commands.cli](jboss_cli_commands.cli) in a text editor. Replace occurrences of `reza` with `<your suffix>`. Make sure to switch your FTP client to *binary mode*, if that is not already the default.  Via FTP, upload the JDBC driver to the /site/deployments/tools directory. Make sure to switch to *ASCII mode*. Then upload the jboss_cli_commands.cli and postgresql-module.xml files to the /site/deployments/tools directory as well. Finally, upload the startup.sh file to the root of the FTP path (/).
* Go back to the Overview panel and hit restart.

## Install the Azure CLI
* In order to deploy the application, we will need to [install the Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest).
* Open a console and execute the following to log onto Azure.

	```
	az login
	```
## Start the Application on Managed JBoss EAP
The next step is to get the application up and running on managed JBoss EAP. Follow the steps below to do so.

* Start Eclipse.
* Get the jakartaee-cafe application in the PaaS directory into the IDE. In order to do that, go to File -> Import -> Maven -> Existing Maven Projects. Then browse to where you have this repository code in your file system and select paas/jakartaee-cafe. Accept the rest of the defaults and finish.
* Once the application loads, open the [pom.xml](jakartaee-cafe/pom.xml) file and replace occurrences of `reza` with `<your suffix>`. You should do a full Maven build by going to Right click the application -> Run As -> Maven install.
* You should note the pom.xml. In particular, we have included the configuration for the Azure Maven plugin we are going to use to deploy the application to managed JBoss EAP:

```xml
<plugin>
    <groupId>com.microsoft.azure</groupId>
    <artifactId>azure-webapp-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>2.8.0</version>
    <configuration>
        <appName>jakartaee-cafe-web-reza</appName>
        <resourceGroup>jakartaee-cafe-group-reza</resourceGroup>
	<javaVersion>Java 11</javaVersion>
	<webContainer>JBossEAP 7</webContainer>
	<deployment>
            <resources>
                <resource>
                    <directory>${project.basedir}/target</directory>
                    <includes>
                        <include>jakartaee-cafe.war</include>
                    </includes>
                </resource>
            </resources>
        </deployment>
    </configuration>
</plugin>
```

* It is now time to deploy and run the application on Azure. Right click the application -> Run As -> 'Maven build...'. Enter the name as 'Deploy to Azure'. Enter the goals as 'azure-webapp:deploy'. Hit run.
* Keep an eye on the console output. You will see when the application is deployed. The application will be available at https://jakartaee-cafe-web-your-suffix.azurewebsites.net.
* Once the application starts, you can test the REST service at the URL: https://jakartaee-cafe-web-your-suffix.azurewebsites.net/rest/coffees or via the JSF client at https://jakartaee-cafe-web-your-suffix.azurewebsites.net/index.xhtml.
